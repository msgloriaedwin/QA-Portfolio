## About Me

I have developed a strong foundation in quality assurance and customer satisfaction through my diverse career journey.
I started my career as a customer care representative working my way from the bottom up. This really made me understand the needs of the customers to better serve them.

During this period I increased customer satisfaction to a 90% rating over a 24 month period. 
I was praised for working as part of the team that increased company sales by 30 percent in 6 months and for volunteering to work closely with the engineering team to fix customer complaints, especially with the Quality Assurance team. As a result, I was promoted to a software quality assurance analyst.

I did that for two years, loved it but I wanted more growth and development opportunities, then I moved over to Social Connector and took a management role to lead the quality assurance team. I love managing teams and solving customer problems.
I particularly enjoy this career, especially the opportunity to build seamless products for customers and discover bugs that could become showstoppers for the business.

I was able to work with the engineering team developers, product designers, testers, product managers, and other key stakeholders like the marketers, the content team and others. Together, we built a stable software product, which contributed to a 25% increase in sales over eight months.

A little bit about me: in my spare time, I love reading, especially books on personal development, to empower myself and expand my knowledge and also love gardening.

I enjoy helping companies improve their products to boost customer satisfaction and business growth. As a software tester, I focus on ensuring high-quality software delivery, which enhances user experience and trust. I take pride in being a positive team player and addressing customer concerns. I know that one of your companyâ€™s core values is putting customers first, I believe my dedication to thorough testing and improvement makes me a great fit for this role. If you hire me, you'll see a noticeable increase in software quality and reliability, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
